									Hi! I am Jan. 

									Born and raised in Tübingen, I am currently living in Potsdam while pursuing my Master's degree in <a href="https://www.ibi.hu-berlin.de/de/studium/studiengaenge/master">Information Science</a> at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. I recently returned to Potsdam after spending some time studying abroad at <a href="https://www.oslomet.no/" target="_blank">Oslo Metropolitan University</a>. Although I initially pursued studies in Law and Political Science & Public Administration, I have now found my passion in <i>Information Science</i>. Currently, I am in the early stages of planning my Master's thesis.
									<br>
									<br>
									If you want to know more about my <i>academic background & work experience</i>, you can have a look at it <a href="#work">here</a>.<br>
									If you are interested in <i>other stuff</i> I do outside of work & study or interesting links to <i>stuff I have done</i>, go <a href="#other">here</a>.<br>
									If you want to <i>get in touch</i> you can find my contact details <a href="#contact">here</a>.

								<h2>Academic Background & Work Experience</h2>
							</header>
							<p style="text-align: left">
								<b><u>Bachelor</u></b><br>
							During my Bachelor's degree, I immersed myself in the work of public libraries as influental institutional players within a community. I was mainly interested in how they can provide a space for public discourse, empower marginalized communities and thereby tackle problems such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_divide">Digital Divide</a>. As part of my studies, I delved into a case study on one particular public library's handling of right-wing literature, analyzing it from a neo-institutionalist perspective considering the various challenges it faced by the different stakeholders within the community. Additionally, I interned at the district library of Pankow's <a href="https://www.berlin.de/stadtbibliothek-pankow/wir-ueber-uns/diversitaet-vielfalt/" target="_blank">Office for Diversity-Oriented Opening</a> and topped it off with a Bachelor thesis about assessing the availability of LGBTIQ*-literature in the district libraries of Berlin.<br>
							<br>

							<b><u>Master</u></b><br>
							Ever since I started my Master's program in Information Science at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, I have developed a passion for working at the intersection of technology, society, and academia. My main areas of interest revolve around understanding how we interact with information systems and how these systems can either challenge or reinforce societal structures I am also passionate about digital citizenship and how we can actively participate in shaping our digital world. Besides that, I am intrigued by the potential of Open Science and Open Data (think Open Government Data and Open Source) in fostering a more democratic society and academic system. In my upcoming Master thesis, I hope to be able to focus in on the topic of <i>Digital Resilience</i>.<br>
							<br>

							<b><u>Work</u></b><br>
							I have worked in a diverse range of jobs, from the fun-sounding, but for sugar-intake detrimental, work at a chocolate factory, to working in Covid-vaccination centers, to being a student assisstant at the Editorial Office of the <a href="https://www.budrich-journals.de/index.php/dms">dms - der moderne Staat</a> journal, a job I am currently just starting at.<br>
							Among them, the one that left the biggest mark up till now, would be my work as a student assistant for the <a href="https://www.ibi.hu-berlin.de/de/studium/studiengaenge/fernstudium">distant learning programme of the Institute for Library- and Information Science at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin</a>. Not only did I have the chance to collaborate with incredible colleagues, but I also had the opportunity to take on various responsibilities such as organizing lectures and student groups, and swiftly digitizing the entire program when the Covid-19 pandemic hit. These experiences were truly invaluable and continue to shape my professional growth to this day.<br>
							<br>

							<b><u>Languages</u></b><br>
							Apart from my academic and professional pursuits, I love learning new languages. Over time, I have achieved a level of fluency in English and jeg også snakker litt Norsk (bra nok å gå handle eller holder enkle samtaler som snakker om været). Currently, I am in the upper beginner stage of learning Mandarin. So 如果你能理解這個，我熱烈歡迎你來到我的網站 (any corrections are very welcome &#128515).<br>

							<a href="https://www.regenbogen-potsdam.de/" target="_blank"><b><u>Regenbogen Potsdam</u></b></a>&#127752 : Regenbogen Potsdam is an association founded in 2020 during the Corona pandemic. It started out organising a Bike-Pride Parade when social distancing was still a priority. Since joining in 2021, I cherish all the great experiences and wonderful people I have met there. Besides the annually growing Bike-Pride, Regenbogen Potsdam also works on establishing more queer events in Potsdam through a recurring "Stammtisch". So if you are ever in town, check out our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/regenbogenpotsdam/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> for the lastet updates on what we are up to. <br><i>Love is for everyone.
