								<h2>Studies & Work</h2>
							</header>
							<p style="text-align: left">
								<b><u>Academia - Bachelor</u></b><br>
							During my Bachelor's degree, I immersed myself in the work of public libraries as influental institutional players within a community. I was mainly interested in how they can provide a space for public discourse, empower marginalized communities and thereby tackle problems such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_divide">Digital Divide</a>. As part of my studies, I delved into a case study on how one particular public library handling of right-wing literature, analyzing it from a neo-institutionalist perspective considering the various challenges it faced by the different stakeholders within the community. Additionally, I interned at the District library of Pankow's <a href="https://www.berlin.de/stadtbibliothek-pankow/wir-ueber-uns/diversitaet-vielfalt/" target="_blank">Office for diversity-oriented opening</a> and topped it off with a Bachelor thesis about assessing the availability of LGBTIQ*-literature in the district libraries of Berlin.<br>
							<br>

							<b><u>Academia - Master</u></b><br>
							Ever since I started my Master's program in Information Science at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, I have developed a passion for working at the intersection of technology, society, and academia. My main areas of interest revolve around understanding how we interact with information systems and how these systems can either challenge or reinforce societal structures I am also passionate about digital citizenship and how we can actively participate in shaping our digital world. In particular, I am intrigued by the potential of Open Science and Open Data (think Open Government Data and Open Source) in fostering a more democratic society and academic system.<br>
							<br>

							<b><u>Work</u></b><br>
							I have worked in a diverse range of jobs,from the fun-sounding, but for sugar-intake detrimental, work at a chocolate factory, to working in Covid-vaccination centers, to my current job at the Editorial Office of the <a href="https://www.budrich-journals.de/index.php/dms">dms - der moderne Staat</a> journal. <br>
							Among them, the most noteworthy one would be my work as a student assistant for the <a href="https://www.ibi.hu-berlin.de/de/studium/studiengaenge/fernstudium">distant learning programme of the Institute for Library- and Information Science at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin</a>. Not only did I have the chance to collaborate with incredible colleagues, but I also had the opportunity to take on various responsibilities such as organizing lectures and student groups, and swiftly digitizing the entire program when the Covid-19 pandemic hit. These experiences were truly invaluable and continue to shape my professional growth to this day.


							<b><u>Languages</u></b><br>
							Apart from my academic and professional pursuits, I love learning new languages. Over time, I have achieved a level of fluency in English of jeg også snakker litt Norsk (bra nok å gå handle eller holder enkle samtaler som snakker om været). Currently, I am in the upper beginner stage of learning Mandarin. So 如果你能理解這個，我熱烈歡迎你來到我的網站 (any corrections are very welcome &#128515).<br>
